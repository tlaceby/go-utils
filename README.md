# go-utils

A collection of useful functions and *data structures* for the Go programming language. Originally created for the 2022 [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

If you would like to use these functions or modfify them then please feel free to do so. I would like to note however that these functions have not been tested and should be verified before using in any serious application context.
